"Automated Answer Evaluation System using NLP"

This project implements an automated system to evaluate and grade textual answers using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system is designed to assess the correctness and relevance of student responses by comparing them against a model answer. Key features include semantic similarity analysis, keyword extraction, and grading based on content accuracy. This solution aims to streamline the evaluation process in educational institutions, providing fast and consistent feedback.

Technologies: Python, NLP (spaCy, NLTK), Machine Learning
